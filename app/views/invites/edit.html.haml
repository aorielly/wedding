            While little ones are welcome in Telluride, we will be having a child-free wedding and reception on Sunday. Reach out to us if you have any concerns or need help finding child care.

            If you were expecting more members of your party than what is listed, please contact us directly before RSVPing. Space is limited in the venue, and our wedding is not clown-car themed.
